Idee de bonus:
-F      Display a slash (`/') immediately after each pathname that is a
		directory, an asterisk (*) after each that is executable, an at
		sign (`@') after each symbolic link, an equals sign (`=') after
		each socket, a percent sign (`%') after each whiteout, and a ver-
		tical bar (`|') after each that is a FIFO.
